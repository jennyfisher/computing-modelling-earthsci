    "## S-shaped growth and carrying capacity\n",
    "Not many populations grow exponentially for very long -- there are various limitations imposed by the world in which the population grows. In many cases, a population will reach what is called the carrying capacity of its ecosystem, and as this capacity is reached, the population dynamics change and approach a steady state (births = deaths). This kind of growth behavior is simpler than you might expect, and results from some basic assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let's assume that as the population increases, the population density goes up (i.e., people live closer together), making it easier for diseases to spread, and also resulting in fewer resources per individual, which lowers the health of the average individual and makes them more susceptible to disease. The net effect is that as the population increases, the death rate increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our model, we can represent this by making the death rate a function of the population variable, rather than a constant value. For now, assume that the death rate increases **linearly** from 0 to 1 (100%) as the population increases from 0 to 10,000 people. In other words:<br><br>\n",

    "## Overshoot and collapse\n",
    "In the last model, the population found its steady state in a smooth manner; the rate of change decreased as the carrying capacity was approached. But this is not always the case; sometimes the population's growth rate does not decline fast enough as the carrying capacity is reached, leading to overshoot, which is usually followed by a collapse. One way of interpreting this is that the population does not process information about its condition fast enough to change its growth rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic example comes from World War II. In short, the US Coast Guard introduced 29 reindeer to a small Arctic island to serve as a food source if needed. After the war, the island was abandoned. The reindeer had no predators but abundant food, and their population grew to 6,000 by 1963. However, the island was small and there wasn't enough food to sustain them. Over the next few years, there was a massive die-off, with only 42 reindeer left in 1966 and none by the 1980s. You can read the story in comic form here: http://www.stuartmcmillen.com/comics_en/st-matthew-island/#page-1\n",

    "To model this kind of system, we need to add a new **reservoir** to our model to represent the resources. Here we will keep this generic, but you can think of it as representing everything finite the population needs to survive (energy, fresh water, arable land for food production, ...). The size of the Resources reservoir will depend on the size of the Population reservoir, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we construct the model, let's work through some important ideas and assumptions one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Resources**: Resources will decline based on how many resources each person uses in a given year. Since Resources are generic for now, let's assume each person typically consumes 1 resource per year. We are assuming there are no new sources of resources. So:\n",
    "$$Resources\\_Used = 1 * Population$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Resources per person**: The death rate will depend on the remaining resources per person. We can easily represent \"resources per person\" mathematically:\n",
    "$$resources\\_per\\_person = \\frac{Resources}{Population}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Death rate**: We can safely assume that when resources are abundant, the death rate is not affected by the amount of resources. In that state, we can assume death rate is a constant reflecting things like disease and old age. But once the amount of resources gets low, the death percent begins to increase, reflecting the idea that with fewer resources, living conditions will deteriorate, making survival more difficult. To simplify this relationship in our model, we will assume the death rate is 10% when there are at least 9 resources per person, and that below this the death rate increases linearly with decreasing resources according to the following equation. In other words:<br>\n",
    "**If resources per person are >=9, then**:\n",
    "$$death\\_rate = 0.10$$\n",
    "**Otherwise**:\n",
    "$$death\\_rate = -0.1 * resources\\_per\\_person + 1.0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Population**: As in our previous models, the population depends on the birth rate and the death rate. The death rate is now dependent on resource availability, but this complexity should be built into the equation for death rate so the equation for population won't need to change."
