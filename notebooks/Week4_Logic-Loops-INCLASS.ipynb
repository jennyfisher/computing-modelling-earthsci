    "## Making comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "Often we want to compare two values or variables. For example, last week you wrote a program to calculate the effective temperatures of Earth, Venus, and Mars. Imagine you wanted to know which planet was warmer. In this simple case, you could just tell python to print the values to the screen and you could compare them yourself. But this method (1) would be tedious if you needed to do it over and over, (2) wouldn't allow you to automatically choose one (for example the largest) for the next calculation you might need to do, and (3) is prone to human error (tired eyes, anyone?).\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, python has a built-in way to do this, using something called a ***boolean expression***. Boolean expressions are statements that output values that are either *True* or *False*. We use special ***relational operators*** to create boolean expressions that compare two values:\n",

    "|:---------|:--------|:--------|\n",
    "|   <  | a < b | a is less than b|\n",
    "|   >  | a > b | a is greater than b|\n",
    "|   <=  | a <= b | a is less than or equal to b|\n",
    "|   >=  | a >= b | a is greater than or equal b|\n",
    "|   ==  | a == b | a is equal to b|\n",
    "|   !=  | a != b | a is not equal to b|\n",
    "\n",
    "The first four are the same as what you would write mathematically. Note that it is important to use the correct order (e.g. `>=` not `=>`) or you will get a syntax error. **Be very careful with the equality operator `==`.** If you forget and use a single equal sign `=` you are not checking whether two values are the same but instead assigning a new value to the variable on the left. For example, `C == 5` asks whether C has a value of 5, but `C=5` assigns the value of 5 to C from here on out.\n",
