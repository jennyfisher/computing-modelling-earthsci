The rest of the planet is covered by gray soil. The daisies receive energy from the sun and water and nutrients from the soil. The atmosphere is very simple, with no clouds and no greenhouse gases. You can read more about Daisyworld in Chapter 2 of the textbook.\n",

That  fraction of incoming energy that is reflected is known as the **albedo**. \n",
