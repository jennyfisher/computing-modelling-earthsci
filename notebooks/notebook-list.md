Student versions of the notebooks can be found here. For solutions, email jennyf@uow.edu.au.

Note: some of the formatting does not render properly in "View" mode (which also does not allow you to interactively run the code cells). A better option is to download the notebook files and open using Jupyter Notebook, which you can get by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) (Python 2 version).

These notebooks are a work in progress and may be updated at any time.
