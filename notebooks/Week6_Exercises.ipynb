    "<font color=blue>You might remember from last week that **flowers die at a constant rate of 0.3** (fraction/year).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using your two functions, you are now going to experiment with different values for the fraction of the planet covered by daisies. For each experiment you should:\n",
    "1. First calculate the temperature of the planet.\n",
    "2. Use that temperature to calculate the flower growth rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the way we have set up these functions, you can only use ONE input value -- they won't work with arrays. So here you are just going to pick some random values for the fraction of the planet covered by flowers and use the functions you've already written to test them, one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example, using what we've already found in 3a and 3b. First, we wanted to understand what happens when we start with 0.5 of the planet covered by flowers. In 3a, we used the function defined in 3a with 0.5 as input to calculate the effective temperature. We found that the effective temperature in that scenario was about 289 K. Then in 3b we used the function defined in 3b with 289 K as input to calculate the growth rate. We found the growth rate was about 0.79. In other words, by using our two functions one after another, we found that with 0.5 fractional coverage, the temperature is 289 K and flowers are growing at a rate of 0.79.\n",
    "\n",
    "We did the same thing starting with a starting fraction of 0.8. We called the first function with 0.8 as input (3a), found an effective temperature of 269 K, and used that as input to the second function (3b) to find a growth rate of 0. At 0.8 fractional coverage, the temperature is 269 K and the growth rate is 0 (i.e. flowers are not growing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to repeat this process choosing different numbers as your starting point. We already know that at 0.5 coverage flowers are growing rapidly, and at 0.8 coverage they are not growing at all. Test out some different numbers (your choice!) to answer the following questions:\n",
    "1. For what range of initial daisy coverage values are the flowers **increasing** in area (i.e. growth > death)? Why?\n",
    "2. In that range (when flowers are increasing), is the temperature of the planet likely to get warmer or colder?\n",
    "3. For what range of daisy coverage values are the flowers **decreasing** in area? Why? What does that mean for the temperature?\n",
    "\n",
    "Use comments to show your thinking as you experiment. You can more cells if you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: DO NOT re-define your functions. All you need to do now is call them with different input values."
