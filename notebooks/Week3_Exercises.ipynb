The Daisyworld climate system is described in detail in Chapter 2 of the textbook. Briefly, Daisyworld is a very simple planet with only one species of life on its surface: pure white daisies. The rest of the planet is covered by gray soil. The daisies receive energy from the sun and nutrients from the soil. The atmosphere has no clouds or greenhouse gases.<br><br>\n",
