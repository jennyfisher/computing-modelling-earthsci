    "This week we are finally going to connect some of the Earth's spheres! Our framework here is the short-term global carbon cycle. Our goal is to model changes in atmospheric carbon since 1958, when observational records began at Mauna Loa in Hawaii -- and then compare them to observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time you get to build much of the model yourselves. The information below will tell you all you need to know about the reservoirs and fluxes to include in your model. All reservoir sizes are in Gigatons of Carbon (Gt C), and all fluxes are in Gt C/yr."
